Working Process
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:175px ; margin-right:175px">Alcohol sensor will detect the alcohol level from air, which is presented in the steering to
detect the alcohol level in air breath out by driver. If level of alcohol is detected then it will be
send message to Arduino microcontroller. This Microcontroller compares the level of alcohol send
by the sensor with normal level of alcohol. If the level of alcohol detected in the sensor is higher
than normal level then microcontroller execute the code which would not allow the driver to start
the car. If the alcohol level is become high while car in moving condition then the car will be stop
like parking and send message to owner using GSM. This work aims at designing an obstacle
detection system using an ultrasonic sensor interfaced with an Arduino board to track location,
alert will be generated send SMS by using GSM module. When person is detected by using
ultrasonic sensor the engine will be slow down when a person is very near to ultrasonic engine
will be automatic stops this SMS and location will sent to Authorized person using GSM and GPS.
Alcohol detection is performed in real-time by the alcohol sensor, the Arduino
microcontroller, and Analog to digital converter circuit. Thus there is never a situation when the
system is in a shadow or a sleep state. In the GPS based drunk and drive detection project, the
system generates an alarm once the level of alcohol measured above a set threshold value. At the
