<h3 style="padding-left:175px ; padding-right:175px">Conclusion</h3>
<p style="padding-left:175px ; padding-right:175px ; font-size:20px">An effective solution is provided to develop the intelligent system for vehicles which will
sense the various levels of alcohol present in the breath of the driver and would respond
accordingly. The system adopted different principles as explained in this paper, by using hardware
platform whoâ€˜s Core is Atmega8, Alcohol sensor mq3,Ultrasonic sensor, GPS & GSM module.
The communication with preregistered phone numbers in this designed system is done via GSM,
GPS and control of various parameters. The whole control system has the benefit of small volume
and high reliability. Future scope of this system is to decrease accident numbers and providing
useful details about the accidental vehicle, thereby reducing the rate of accidents taking place due
to drunken driving. This system brings modernization to the existing technology in the vehicles
and also maintains and improves the safety features, hence proving to be an effective development
in the automobile industry.
GPS alcohol detecting and engine locking system using GSM system has been successfully
implemented. This system divided into three sub system GPS, GSM and Arduino Nano subsystem.
When the MQ3 sensor are detecting the alcohol in the car then beeping a sound in car that means
altering to driver and GPS is use for the position of the car in the from longitude and latitude
format. This longitude and latitude are receiving by the GSM with help of Arduino system GSM
forward this information to the user or owner mobile number who is preregister and then the user
can be tracker location of the car and the Engine of the car will be stop. This work aims at designing
an obstacle detection system using an ultrasonic sensor interfaced with an Arduino board to track
location, alert will be generated send SMS by using GSM module. When person is detected by
using ultrasonic sensor the engine will be slow down when a person is very near to ultrasonic
engine will be automatic stops this SMS and location will sent to Authorized person using GSM
and GPS.</p>
