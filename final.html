<br><h4 style="padding-left:175px ; padding-right:175px ; font-size:20px ; color:white ; font-style:bold ; background-color:black" ;>These days, majority of road accidents are caused by drink driving. Drunken drivers are in
an unstable condition and so, rash decision are made on highway which condition endangers the
lives of road users, the driver inclusive. However, effective monitoring of drunk and drivers is the
challenging to the policeman and the road safety officers. Many research officer’s efforts have
been directed to the design of efficient system that will monitor drunk driving. This project
developed a prototype alcohol detection and engine locking system by using Arduino uno
microcontroller interface with an alcohol sensor along with an lcd screen and a DC motor to
demonstrate the concept. India had earned distinction in having more number of casualties due to
road accidents around the world. Road safety is appearing as a big social concern around the world
especially in India. Drinking and driving is a serious issue which probably would emerge as one
of the most significant problems in the near future. The system proposed by us focus at minimizing
number of road accidents in the near future because of drunk driving. The system detects the
alcohol level present in the air inside the vehicle. At low level it sends an SMS to the preregistered
contacts while at high level it locks the engine immediately and at the same time sends SMS along
with the location to three pre-selected contacts. Hence the system will reduce the number of road
accidents and casualties due to drunk driving in future.
INDIA the world’s second most populated country. Being a developing nation it faces
many problems, which it tackles decently except road accidents. The mass/main reason for road
accidents being drink and drive cases. Each year around 50,000 peoples die due to road accidents.
The central nervous system is affected by alcohol. The ability to control steering is affected even
at 0.05% BAC (Blood Alcohol Concentration). In case of public transport, the triggering of buzzer
creates awareness among the passengers traveling in that vehicle. The GSM module sends the
information of the position and alcohol content in the driver’s body to the nearest police station by
using GPS.</h4>
