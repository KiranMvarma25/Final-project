The motive of this project the alcohol is detected by the alcohol sensor MQ3 which is the senses
in the car while incase drink alcohol, and the sensor send a signal to microcontroller which forward
a particular signal to the GSM. The GSM send a message to a particular preregister mobile that
the driver is drunken burger beeping and led is indicated red and then the engine will be stopped.
If any other person want to drive it send a particular message to the system will be unlocked but
alcohol sensor continue working. This work aims at designing an obstacle detection system using
an ultrasonic sensor interfaced with an Arduino board to track location, alert will be generated
send SMS by using GSM module. When person is detected by using ultrasonic sensor the engine
will be slow down when a person is very near to ultrasonic engine will be automatic stops this
SMS and location will sent to Authorized person using GSM and GPS. In this way owner get the
real location by receiving the exact position of the car. It will be copied to the google map and the
location of that car and easily be accessed.
